It contains a short use case of regular expressions for sentence parsing. We show the differences between LIKE and full-text search that are used in SQL databases. A major topic included in this section are NLP methods that can be used for easier sentence comparison. Finally, we build a simple example of questions and answers that can be used by chatbots."
