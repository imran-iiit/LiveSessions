You can get a copy of class materials at any time from the resource widget (green file folder) in your widget tray.

Ali R 9/10/2018 8:45 PM
kafka is something like ELK stack?

Razat N 9/10/2018 8:48 PM
i think ELK uses it to collect the data

Bharti K 9/10/2018 8:52 PM
what is decouple?

Maik T 9/10/2018 8:52 PM
take two things apart. separate things

Bharti K 9/10/2018 8:53 PM
thanks

Maik T 9/10/2018 8:53 PM
you're welcome

Lala V 9/10/2018 9:00 PM
What make Kafka more effcient that regular JMS. I mean the throughput and speed?

Lala V 9/10/2018 9:01 PM
Is there any underlying change in TCP layer?

Raman M 9/10/2018 9:09 PM
what are the some latest alternatives of Kafka?

Maik T 9/10/2018 9:12 PM
I recently learned about this: https://pulsar.incubator.apache.org/

Maik T 9/10/2018 9:12 PM
still early though

Raman M 9/10/2018 9:14 PM
thanks - kinesis is another option?

Maik T 9/10/2018 9:14 PM
haven't come across this one

Maik T 9/10/2018 9:16 PM
If I have a topic with just one partition - will this partition still be replicated to a second cluster node? Like master/ slave...

Razat N 9/10/2018 9:17 PM
is zookeeper on every node ?

Maik T 9/10/2018 9:17 PM
ah, "replication factor" seems to be the answer fo my question

Jyothy K 9/10/2018 9:18 PM
i don't think so zookeepe r on every node; zookeeper is the one who elects leader when one of the node goes down

David S 9/10/2018 9:18 PM
@Razat, no, zookeper is a discovery mechanism for the nodes, so you need one per cluster.

Jeff C 9/10/2018 9:18 PM
Zookeepr is a separate service, but can run on the same server as the broker.

David S 9/10/2018 9:18 PM
or just one

Jeff C 9/10/2018 9:19 PM
You would tend to have fewer zookeepers then brokers in your cluster.

Jeff C 9/10/2018 9:24 PM
Does anyone have the git repo path?

Siddaraju G 9/10/2018 9:25 PM
github repo? Not seeing in slides or resource list

Maik T 9/10/2018 9:26 PM
nope, could someone please post the repo?

Jeff C 9/10/2018 9:26 PM
Nurul I - Can you share the git path with us? Thank you

Here is the link: https://github.com/SciSpike/kafka-lab

Nurul I 9/10/2018 9:28 PM
It will be added to the resource widget for today and tomorrow's session

mahmoud a 9/10/2018 9:29 PM
black screen

Nurul I 9/10/2018 9:30 PM
Please refresh your screen to see if that helps

Anand A 9/10/2018 9:31 PM
How long messages will be there in topic?

David S 9/10/2018 9:33 PM
Arand you can configure it

Anna K 9/10/2018 9:33 PM
Can someone provide the github link for the exercises?

Nurul I 9/10/2018 9:34 PM
Here is the link: https://github.com/SciSpike/kafka-lab

Anna K 9/10/2018 9:34 PM
TY!

Nurul I 9/10/2018 9:35 PM
You are welcome!

Maik T 9/10/2018 9:46 PM
was it just lab 01?

Anna K 9/10/2018 9:47 PM
I am getting an error with docker-compose up command

Anna K 9/10/2018 9:47 PM
ERROR: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)

Anna K 9/10/2018 9:47 PM
I wonder if it might have to do with the ports Peter mentioned

Hemant S 9/10/2018 9:58 PM
when we call this producer proxy how it will know where is the master node for that partitiion?

Jeff C 9/10/2018 9:58 PM
Once it talks with one broker it will know everything it needs for all brokers.

Lala V 9/10/2018 10:19 PM
Is there a magic formula between throughpu and number of partitions?

Michal P 9/10/2018 10:19 PM
Is offset managed per consumer group or a consumer?

Jeff C 9/10/2018 10:19 PM
Per group id

Jeff C 9/10/2018 10:21 PM
Lala V - Maybe, but it would depend a lot on the usage.

Lala V 9/10/2018 10:21 PM
should that be key.deserializer in example?

Lala V 9/10/2018 10:22 PM
Thanks Jeff.Can I add more partitions similar to adding new kafka nodes to achieve more parallelism?

Lala V 9/10/2018 10:23 PM
pete mentioned that there is a limit on number of paritions that we can have

Jeff C 9/10/2018 10:24 PM
Yes. You can also have more then on portion for the same topic on the same broker, but at some point you will max out the performance of the server itself.

Kshitij P 9/10/2018 10:24 PM
more parallelism is only by adding more partitions (off-course there is a limit), adding more kafka nodes could be there to support more degree of replication.

Maik T 9/10/2018 10:24 PM
Is there a limit until the total amount of topics becomes unmanagable?

Jeff C 9/10/2018 10:24 PM
There is a limit, not sure that it is, but you don't need to worry about that limit.

Lala V 9/10/2018 10:24 PM
Got it Thanks

Maik T 9/10/2018 10:24 PM
:-)

Lala V 9/10/2018 10:27 PM
Is the partitions preassigned per consumer. I mean if a consumer is consumng from partition 1 will it is always be consuming from partition 1 unless there is a rebalance in the paritions?

Kshitij P 9/10/2018 10:28 PM
yup, till the time we do not change the number of consumers in that consumer group.

Lala V 9/10/2018 10:30 PM
I assume the offsets are per partitions and not per topid. So each consumer based on the commit will have its own offset

Jeff C 9/10/2018 10:30 PM
per topic per partition.

Lala V 9/10/2018 10:30 PM
Also it the eoffset unique within partitions or it is unique for a topic?

Kshitij P 9/10/2018 10:30 PM
offsets are per consumer per partition per consumer group.

Lala V 9/10/2018 10:31 PM
I mean the offset numbers

Lala V 9/10/2018 10:31 PM
Thanks

Ek C 9/10/2018 11:01 PM
On Windows, how may I run producer and consumer in lab 2?

Ek C 9/10/2018 11:02 PM
(I got the below error.)

Ek C 9/10/2018 11:02 PM
Î» producer 'producer' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

Kshitij P 9/10/2018 11:05 PM
close :)

Maik T 9/10/2018 11:05 PM
nice

Lala V 9/10/2018 11:11 PM
Does Kafka support Headers similar to JMS headers. For JMS consumers can have message selectors to skip the messages. Do we have something like that?

Michal P 9/10/2018 11:14 PM
can number of partitions be increased dynamically?

Kshitij P 9/10/2018 11:18 PM
@Michal, we can but 1 there is a pause involved, 2 the keys get messed up as they get assigned to other partitions.

Lala V 9/10/2018 11:18 PM
Should a producer also match number of partitions?

Kshitij P 9/10/2018 11:19 PM
@Lala, nope

Lala V 9/10/2018 11:20 PM
Thanks..Also if messages are send parallel.. from teh consumer perspective, if my current message processing is dependednt on what was processed already, how can I know if the previous message landed in another partition?

Lala V 9/10/2018 11:24 PM
Also Just curious.. what is the too used by Pete to draw and show?..Looks cool

Nurul I 9/10/2018 11:28 PM
Thank you for joining us today for Day 1 of class. We will see you all for Day 2 tomorrow at the same time, 8:00 am PDT. Have a great rest of the day or night everyone!

Anna K 9/10/2018 11:28 PM
Did anyone see this?

Anna K 9/10/2018 11:28 PM
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally docker: Error response from daemon: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers). See 'docker run --help'.

Anna K 9/10/2018 11:28 PM
I don't seem to have a hello-world image
