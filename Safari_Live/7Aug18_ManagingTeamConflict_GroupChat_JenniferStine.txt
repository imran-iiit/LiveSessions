Mahantesh S H
1. Trust each other in the team, work cohesively

Jenny S
trust and cohesion are key!

Sivakumar R
Best Team Experience Team members are rewarded when they have done their best Worst Team Experience conflict arise within the team when we get around solving a probelm

Eric B
Best: When everyone (including management) was working towards a common, well understood goal.

Eric B
Worst: When management appeared to have no responsibility, simply passing along their pain to the staff.

Barry G
Best: Collaboration Team consensus Effective solutions Worst: Disagreement on design Communication breaks down and becomes one-sided Progress comes to a halt

Kay M
Best: transparent and fun

Jawad S
Best experience was when I worked with the team to do a maintenance on a major client’s server. We really communicated well, followed a project plan to the tee and hit one task at a time out of the park. We under promised and over delivered!

Erin M
Best: Great collaboration, great team, complete independence, freedom to create, similar peers, but with different skill sets. Great trust among the team.

Ludmila B
1. team noticing need to support one of a team members, giving him a hand in difficult situation

Andreea G
Worst team experience * looking for a scapegoat when there’s a problem * blame culture: no one comes forward, people afraid of admitting mistakes

Michelle W
Best Team experience Small tight team. We were able to get the project done on time without killing ourselves. Components- Similar working and communication styles Autonomy to make decisions defined goals

Kay M
worst: manager taking no responsibility and blaming all others for failings

Mahantesh S H
equal opportunity

Michelle W
Worst Team experience Drama Protecting turf Communication shut down

Prateek S
Best Experience When I did the analysis that was a blocking our project progress. I had sat down late in office and went through all the system configuration and documentation to figure out why it was happening. The impact of this discovery led to a fruit

Sandy E
Best: actually getting stuff done

Bill T
Worst: yelling at each other across the table (at the end of the project, I learned that we didn't have the same assumptions or directions from management)

Ludmila B
2. worst: personal attacks when emotions run high

Erin M
Worst: Environment of selfishness, back biting, gossip, diminishing of skills, tall poppy syndrome, limiting you to a little box. Very boxed in. No open communication, no trust. Win-lose mentality.

ANDRES ALBERTO D
Is there any audio?

Yudhveer S
Best: Support each other and help each other getting better in everything

Jawad S
Worst experience was when we experienced an outage for one of our other major client’s environment. We were all over the place with respect to communication, we had no proper channels in place for escalation points. There was no team cohesiveness.

Mahantesh S H
personal grudge when given a negative (fact) feedback

Sachin D
best team work exp All team work together to reach the goal Enough work or more than enough work, everyone engage and bz a lot. Giving hand to each other worst team work exp Same project PM kept the team hanging state during go live. ppl loose trust

COLLEEN O
worst conflict is when I've had responsibility without the power.

Jacob B
Best: Excellent communication between the team members and those outside the team. Worst: Team members became defensive and personalities clashed.

Mahantesh S H
yes

Elizabeth R
Best: No egos, able to disagree professionally, care about eachother

Bill T
Best: Things just got done thru.. .telepathy? we could anticipate each others actions. Because we have the level of trust.

Yudhveer S
Worst Exp: No goals and direction

Blair J
Worst: team and product owner disagree on fundamentals in scrum approach and end up in constant conflict

Elizabeth R
Worst: Belittling, management thru fear and retribution

COLLEEN O
experiences are better when people have reasonable communications skills and the ability to constructively express thought

Casey C
Best: Differences of opinion on how something should be done.

Blair J
Is conflict different than disagreement?

Ram R
technical conflict is a good thing: what happens in the meeting STAYS in the meeting

Elizabeth R
help: healthy debate that doesn't get personal

Ludmila B
conflict helped to find a new solution which wasn't obvious at the beginning

Casey C
Resulting, ultimately, in a better outcome

Prateek S
Worst Experience When we had a change of manager and a change in team lead and the new guy is purely numbers driven while the team lead is so much empathetic. Manager is shouting at all times while lead is trying to push us just a little out of the comfor

Erin M
Positive conflict: discussion of ideas and concepts, negative: getting personal

Daniel P
During the decision making process when you are entertaining new ideas

Bill T
Helpful: When it forces you to explore the nooks of all the thinking.

Claire M
Help: differing opinions on how to approach a work item - open discussions on the conflicting opinions help develope best solutions

Yudhveer S
Conflict which helps: different solution each with their own pros and Cons

Eric B
Helpful Conflict - that which leads to better understanding and gets resolved.

Kay M
ditto with Erin M

Elizabeth R
spirited debate=good screaming and belittling+bad

COLLEEN O
conflict can bring to light an unknown problem

Michelle W
Conflict helps when people can discuss options and trust our team members not to belittle our ideas

Daniel P
Detrimental conflict, personal, when a decision is made not backing the decision.

Yudhveer S
- Egoistical and power driven

Prateek S
Is it a valid point that I don't exist in the Rare but Substantive Conflict because I am very early in my career and though I give brilliant ideas, but then they are just ideas, not potential points of conflict?

Michelle W
Rare and Shallow

Bill T
Rare but substanitive

Erin M
Frequent and substantive.

Barry G
Rare between substantive and shallow - depends on the issue

Prateek S
Thanks, I will print it first thing tomorrow!

Nicolas C
Cant t you be several kind depending on the topic ?

Erin M
Or circular conflict

Prateek S
Yes, you can Nicolas. I guess it's a varying degree of the behavior. You can be both, just like being an ambivert.

Erin M
Nicolas C: I think makes you rare but Substantive

COLLEEN O
there is no buy in. Sam did all the work. No one else knows what is going on.

Erin M
What were the review results?

Eric B
What does 'done' mean?

Elizabeth R
If I were to ask your team mates would they agree that "we got everything done"

COLLEEN O
What has been done?

Tereasa W
Has it been tested?

Arnold E
ask Sam what were the steps he followed

Nikhil K
Does code review mean that the work is complete?

Jacob B
How can we get everyone else on the same page?

Mahantesh S H
when we communicate the results'

Jawad S
no clarity

Prateek S
I would need a list of topics covered, preferably documented for the whole team to be able to see in a shared place

Erin M
How does the review affect our next approach

COLLEEN O
did we test the code to make certain it's correct?

Amit Kumar S
What has been done and what is the observations?

Sivakumar R
is it as per the scope of the project

Prateek S
Why does Sam decide we are ready to move on to next module?

Ludmila B
show us what is done

ukiwa i
engage the team - Inquire if all feel the same way ?

Daniel P
query the team as to their preferences

Yudhveer S
get details on sam's review

Arnold E
go around the room and ask to hear from everyone

Andreea G
I guess we have to support Sam if we want to have buy in...

Prateek S
Bad decision. Debugging becomes costlier as you move thru the timeline. There's some law named as such.

Blair J
Find out why he wants to move on.

Ludmila B
check the team's confidence level

Jacob B
He needs to communicate why bypassing the process is the correct approach

Barry G
Discuss the importance of the process

Michelle W
find out why Sam wants to move on. Perhaps there is pressure from the business to move forward.

Tereasa W
Let the clients know that the deadline will need to move and then follow the process - it has to be tested before putting in production and breaking things

Ram R
there needs to be a little more control over the process here...

Javier V
establish what the criterion are for selecting among the options

Cristian C
ask everyone what is their expectation of finding no serious production issues

Sivakumar R
depends on how many team members support for either of this

Anish X
Straw poll

Jawad S
Since Sam never shared the details on the work that was performed, we need to see the documentation that there were no gaps and everything was followed. Everything must be documented, the steps that were taken, the findings, the results.

Nicolas C
What is the real point: just meet the deadline or deliver a good "product"

Michelle W
Weigh the cost of skipping the QA process with the gains of moving forward

Jawad S
that would dicated the next steps

Prateek S
Typo in the second point: 'As' instead of 'Ask'

Kate S
How do you avoid getting the deer in headlights from introverts or quiet people?

Anish X
Would a rose-bud-thorn approach help in such a situation?

Luis M
assume responsability

Jawad S
he should make the decision based on everyones feedback

Sivakumar R
reward for best suggestion

Ram R
ensure those that disagree still commit

Prateek S
Postpone the deadline, intimate the client. If this thing goes south, it will reflect badly on the whole team for the fault of one person. If it goes well, well then, consider it good luck because you didn’t account for risks.

Ludmila B
fist of five

Michelle W
I don't like the phrase "the right decision" I would word it as "the best decision".

Michelle W
There may not be a right decision. There may only be the least painful one

have an initial getting to know session

yes - focus groups to leverage strengths

An ice breaker event should help

SANKHADEEP B
do an offsite

get everyone onto a video call to introduce everyone to each other

Prateek S
Giving out a team award early on :P

Ram R
👍

Nicolas C
How does that model live in the real world, where things like turn over happen ?

Blair J
Yes pls...my team is stuck in forming/norming

Blair J
sorry forming/storming...

Andreea G
I guess that's really common Blair...

Nicolas C
:+1:

Blair J
:)

Nicolas C
Yes thanks.

Prateek S
Yeah, that was my worst experience: Micromanagement.

Andreea G
we were stuck in storming because things were changing too much - team membership, scope, roles, etc

Blair J
What the team wants to go in unproductive directions...

Blair J
different assumptions...

Anish X
How is this implemented in a fast moving (high attrition) work space?

Prateek S
I guess, if the team as a whole wants to go in unproductive directions, they may be avoiding the manager/lead. Just saying!

Andreea G
@Anish: do you mean high turnover? If yes, can't be done IMO...

Anish X
oh... okay

Yudhveer S
get ideas or veiws from all

Ludmila B
facilitate making decision

Eric B
clarify goals

Ram R
what is the nature of conflict? work? process? personality

Ram R
?

Prateek S
Put the discussions in more visible places, like document it online.

COLLEEN O
step back

Ed S
Whiteboard to move on.

Mahantesh S H
talk about or focus on "what next"?

Andreea G
maybe the goals are unclear, or there's not enough buy-in on the team purpose. I would investigate that...

Jacob B
Try to move the conversation forward. Focus on actionable items

Blair J
Could address the scrum principle of no team lead at some point. Scrum is very ambiguous on the topic of leadership...

Anish X
Set clear goals/actions

Blair J
?

Elizabeth R
What obstacles can I remove for you?

Ed S
Tell them they're all wrong and to start from scratch. ;)

COLLEEN O
run away

Anish X
lol

Prateek S
Create progressive agenda and review and convey what was covered in the last meeting and move on.

Ludmila B
ask abstract question

Ed S
Narrow the scope

Ed S
Break the tension

Yudhveer S
get each problems and address them with severity

Ed S
Divert the conversation

Prateek S
They may be burning out, have an offsite!

COLLEEN O
take the course on how to manage your manager

Bill T
start looking for another job?

Kay M
LOL, like that one Bill

Jerome T
start working from home

Andreea G
well, changing teams usually works

Prateek S
They micromanage, we burnout.

Anish X
Chastise them

Ram R
refer him to this course

Michelle W
I have that right now.

Yudhveer S
manage your manager

Kay M
I have had frank conversations with manager in past

Prateek S
People change managers, not jobs. Just saying!

Ed S
Hide drugs in their car - call the cops

Andreea G
Ed: also don't get caught

COLLEEN O
Ed: lol

Ludmila B
ask the manager if he wants to work with mature, self-organising team. If yes, give them some space

Anish X
Sit down with them and their manager to have a heart-heart

Michelle W
I tell my manager all the time that he is a micro manager.

Ludmila B
it's good to build a bridge

COLLEEN O
lost the audio

COLLEEN O

Andreea G

SANKHADEEP B

COLLEEN O
I lost you just when you started to explain

Kay M

Jenny S
@colleen, see the slide

Bill T
this is a good practice for empathy

Bill T
but I'm not sure I really have gotten into the other party's head.

COLLEEN O
we often don't consider what may be influencing their thoughts

Kate S
I find it easier after the fact. The problem is in the situation.

Sivakumar R
misjudgement

Ludmila B
effective listening is crucial

Ram R
hindsight is 20-20... it is much harder to maintain that situational awareness in the heat of the moment

Jacob B
It was good to consider the other side's perspective but you can never be totally sure of their perspective

Prateek S
Collaboration (Group chat) wins. Got to know how to project confidence, good body language, deftness in a live video. Being humorous and providing good anecdotes, analogies. Trial by a jury was a great example.
