hi from Munich

Nicholas A 8/22/2018 9:53 PM
I may be jumping the gun, so if this is going to be discussed in future slides, I'll wait, but as an architect how do you keep up to date w/ the latest tools/techniques/etc.? Or do you view the concerns that an architect has to manage or technology agnost

Nicholas A 8/22/2018 9:53 PM
ic?

Nicholas A 8/22/2018 9:54 PM
*or -> are

JONATHAN I 8/22/2018 9:55 PM
Did anyone else try to wipe that black mark on the slide off their screen?

Awesome, thanks

asri a 8/22/2018 9:55 PM
Hi from Indonesia.

JONATHAN I 8/22/2018 9:56 PM
Oh year, it was the mouse

Nicholas A 8/22/2018 10:08 PM
How do you handle such situations, when you've never done it before, what is your strategy for handling it? This is what I find most intimidating about the architectural role.

Janet R 8/22/2018 10:11 PM
Q: How far ahead do you think about the architectural decisions you make? Like, do you think how it will hold up in a year, five years, six months?

Janet R 8/22/2018 10:12 PM
My tendency is to think, "would I want to live in this codebase in a year", and I rely a lot on past mistakes to estimate livability. I wonder if you have a more formal approach

Nicholas A 8/22/2018 10:12 PM
Thanks

Janet R 8/22/2018 10:12 PM
but you can get too precious about it

Janet R 8/22/2018 10:14 PM
thanks

Janet R 8/22/2018 11:34 PM
Q: How do you encourage people to do their homework beforehand? e.g. to review a document beforehand

Danilo R 8/22/2018 11:35 PM
Q: About those customers who always entered in the middle of a meeting to show power, did you managed to fix this behaviour?

Janet R 8/22/2018 11:35 PM
Would it help to say "we are making Decision X in this meeting so please come ready with questions"?

Janet R 8/22/2018 11:36 PM
It's been "part of our culture" at most companies to not read ahead of time.

erics h 8/22/2018 11:37 PM
some product manager knows alot about software architecture; how closely architect work with product manager?

P G 8/22/2018 11:40 PM
As a senior product leader, what are the best ways for me to work with an architect?

erics h 8/22/2018 11:40 PM
questions should be addressed in Q&A

Janet R 8/22/2018 11:45 PM
Do you usually have someone take notes? Do they get read? How do you share the responsibility?

Janet R 8/22/2018 11:45 PM
^^ take notes in a meeting, that is

Janet R 8/22/2018 11:46 PM
thanks

James S 8/22/2018 11:51 PM
Re: "Five years from now we will be using something that isnâ€™t invented yet." We (typically) have the opposite problem in the public sector. Any advice for moving things along?

James S 8/22/2018 11:54 PM
10 at least. ;)

James S 8/22/2018 11:55 PM
Thanks

Luis A 8/22/2018 11:56 PM
Great Training material. Thinking Architecturally

Glenn L 8/22/2018 11:56 PM
There seems to be a trend lately that languages are being provided with their own code formatting tools such that there are no more discussions about style, which I find very refreshing.

Nishant K 8/22/2018 11:58 PM
Talk about braces, seen it enough :)

James S 8/23/2018 12:00 AM
@Glenn Agree. If a language requires me to include semi-colons at the end of lines to satisfy the parser/compiler, dictating other formatting decisions makes perfect sense.

Glenn L 8/23/2018 12:11 AM
@James - definitely. Also, integration with all known editors with "format-on-save" just makes programming fun again (with the additional caveat that the compiler must be blinding fast). :-)

Janet R 8/23/2018 12:27 AM
Q: any favorite techniques for retaining knowledge you are no longer using day to day?

Janet R 8/23/2018 12:30 AM
Thanks, s ee you tomorrow!

Nilang P 8/23/2018 12:30 AM
