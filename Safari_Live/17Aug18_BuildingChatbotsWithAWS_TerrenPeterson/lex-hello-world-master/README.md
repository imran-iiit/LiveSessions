## Get started with Lex

Using the AWS console, create your first Lex bot and give it a name. For example, HelloWorld.

Then create your first intent. Just call it something simple like 'Hello'.

Creating an intent involves establishing sample utterances. Pick something simple like 'Hello' or 'Hi'.

## Get started with Lambda

1) Create a new blank lambda function.
2) Copy the [code](https://github.com/terrenjpeterson/lex-hello-world/blob/master/src/lambda.js) in the /src folder into the lambda function.
3) Save.

## Start testing your bot

First make sure that your Lambda function is properly setup. 
From the /testdata folder, use the AWS console to test the function with the [request](https://github.com/terrenjpeterson/lex-hello-world/blob/master/testdata/request.json) object.
After invoking, you should receive a response object that looks like [this](https://github.com/terrenjpeterson/lex-hello-world/blob/master/testdata/response.json).

Once the lambda function properly works, then connect it to Lex. This can be done through the console by changing the Fullfillment radio button on the intent and selecting the Lambda function.
