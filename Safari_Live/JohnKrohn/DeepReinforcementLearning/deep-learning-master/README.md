# Deep Learning

This repository is home to the code that accompanies [Jon Krohn's](https://www.jonkrohn.com/)'s Live Trainings within O'Reilly Safari.

Additional deep learning-related notebooks can be found [here](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/TensorFlow-LiveLessons), including [installation instructions](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/TensorFlow-LiveLessons/tree/master/installation) for running them within Jupyter notebooks on your own machine.
