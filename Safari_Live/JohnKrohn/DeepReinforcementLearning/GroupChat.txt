can you run today's notebooks on a CPU based laptop?

Abdul K 8/16/2018 9:54 PM
Can deep learning totally replace traditional machine learning. When would one resort to traditional ML?

Dan T 8/16/2018 9:56 PM
there is absolutely no overlap between NLP and GANs ?

Gary G 8/16/2018 9:58 PM
Q: There is a signin/register on the page https://resources.oreilly.com/live-training/deep-learning; is that my Safari Login?

Shannon C 8/16/2018 9:59 PM
Great questions everyone! Jon will address them shortly. Thanks!

Ibrahim A 8/16/2018 10:02 PM

Hi Gary, That is an open-source page, so you should not need to enter any log-in. Please try refreshing the page and see if it works for you. Thanks!

Shannon C 8/16/2018 10:03 PM
Thanks Krutarth

Marin M 8/16/2018 10:05 PM
Would you be willing to speak on what you guys use at Untapt? Like, are dense models used in real world applications or are dense models more easily digestible so it makes sense to speak on dense models in this sort of learning format

Q: Do we have different results if we used random seed !

Marin M 8/16/2018 10:54 PM
Would you mind sharing your screen as you go through it

Marin M 8/16/2018 10:55 PM
Haha all good

AMIT D 8/16/2018 10:56 PM
are you saying that we should run this on our machine and not on jupyterhub?

Rohit P 8/16/2018 10:56 PM
where can i find the docker image ?

Matej K 8/16/2018 10:57 PM

thanks

Shannon C 8/16/2018 10:57 PM
Thanks Matej!

Q: is (mini-batch size) * (epochs) = (Training set Size) ?

Clair G 8/16/2018 11:28 PM
I am the only one to not hear the begginning of the talk ?

Shannon C 8/16/2018 11:28 PM

User 1 8/17/2018 12:00 AM
can you please post it here as well?

Shannon C 8/17/2018 12:02 AM
To pull a docker image based on Dockerfile- *gpu* : docker pull godot80/tf-livelessons I can build the other one docker pull godot80/tf-livelessons-no-gpu for the non gpu Dockerfile

Shannon C 8/17/2018 12:23 AM
