@Nurul If I understand correctly Jupyter notebooks are available for next 24 hours only after the class and it is not available through the recording of this class

Abhijit D 8/8/2018 10:19 PM
Thanks, @Ashuthos

Abhijit D 8/8/2018 10:21 PM
@Jon can we download the notebooks to our laptop

Abhijit D 8/8/2018 10:23 PM
@Nurul What user credential for the Oreilly Gitlab. https://resources.oreilly.com/users/sign_in

Nurul I 8/8/2018 10:23 PM
That is correct @Abhijit

Abhijit D 8/8/2018 10:25 PM
@Nurul How do I sign-in to Gitlab?

Nurul I 8/8/2018 10:26 PM
@Abhijit, to clarify you can access the notebooks for sure (in the repo) but the Jupyterhub (where you run the code) goes away after 24 hours.

Nurul I 8/8/2018 10:26 PM
t’s a public repo so you can actually just need to type the following in your terminal:git clone https://resources.oreilly.com/live-training/deep-learning

Mingxiao Y 8/8/2018 10:27 PM
lol thanks!

Abhijit D 8/8/2018 10:30 PM
Thanks @Nurul I was able to clone the repo

Babou S 8/8/2018 10:31 PM
import usually takes sometime

Nurul I 8/8/2018 10:33 PM
@Abhijit, Great! You are welcome!

Babou S 8/8/2018 10:43 PM
she is still appearing in the result after executing [w.lower() for w in gberg_sents[4] if w not in stpwrds]

Katarina K 8/8/2018 10:46 PM
We should also remove stop words in capital: e.g. I, The etc by using [w.lower() for w in gberg_sents[4] if w.lower() not in stpwrds]

ROHIT C 8/8/2018 10:48 PM

Abhijit D 8/8/2018 11:36 PM
@Jon word2vec should work for any language for ex: mandarin etc. Is the input to the word2vec should be native script or unicode representation is enough

BALA VENKATESWARA RAO G 8/8/2018 11:41 PM
I am working Email text analytics the mail may contains about the product name model type to but the product i need to fetch only the product name,model type or we receive a mail about the feeback about the product can anyone help on this?

Soubhik R 8/8/2018 11:42 PM
Q: Can we detect phrase using word2vec?

Abhijit D 8/8/2018 11:44 PM
@Bala what will be the output of your text analytic model? Is it a side project or work project

BALA VENKATESWARA RAO G 8/8/2018 11:45 PM
work project

Jocelyn Z 8/8/2018 11:46 PM
For wrod2vec, if there's a word that never existed in the training set, when we apply the trained model to that word what kind of result would we get back?

Abhijit D 8/8/2018 11:48 PM
@Jon - is word2vec is unsupervised learning can it be used in combination with Topic Modeling - unsupervised algorithm

BALA VENKATESWARA RAO G 8/8/2018 11:50 PM
@Abhijit D May i know which model we can use

Abhijit D 8/8/2018 11:51 PM
@Jon can you please explain what an epoch is? I confused with epoch and iterations

Michael K 8/8/2018 11:52 PM
Are there any ways of getting around the 100 words limit? What if we don't want to truncate/ pad the review?

Abhijit D 8/9/2018 12:02 AM
@Jon is their positive and negative word list to calculate the sentiment?

Abhijit D 8/9/2018 12:05 AM
@Jon how to handle reviews with sparse contents for example just one word review - good horrible must-see etc. Do we still pad these one word movie reviews

Babou S 8/9/2018 12:13 AM
where in the model I say expected outcome, like I am looking for sentiment classification.. or I am looking for misspelled word in the review..?

Richard D 8/9/2018 12:19 AM
