Hi Jaime

Audio is streaming continuously...please try refreshing your browser, or if that doesn't work - leaving and rejoining the course.

We also recommend using Chrome if you aren't already, disconnecting from any VPN, and closing out any other program that may be using bandwidth.

Let's take 10 mins for the exercise. Please post any questions if you have them.

Shannon C 9/5/2018 11:11 PM
We're back! You should hear Aurélien again.
