Introduction to TensorFlow
In the first part of this course, you will learn the fundamentals of TensorFlow, such as computational graphs, auto-differentiation, sessions, placeholders and more. You will then learn how to apply this knowledge by building a simple logistic re...

Q from group chat: When exactly should we use Tensorflow over Keras given the code complexity is higher in Tensorflow as compared to Keras API? @aurelien (edited)

Screenshare appears in the red media player widget within the course platform. You can move the widgets around as needed.

aurelien [10:55 PM]
Everything clear so far?

Shannon Cutt [10:55 PM]
We're taking 10 mins to complete exercise 1. Please post any questions if you have them. :slightly_smiling_face:

ramkrishna [10:55 PM]
how do you sign into https://resources.oreilly.com/live-training/introduction-to-tensorflow?

aurelien [10:56 PM]
I believe it’s with your Safari credentials, right @Shannon Cutt? (edited)

Shannon Cutt [10:56 PM]
That page is actually open and does not require a log-in. @ramkrishna Please try refreshing the page and let me know if that works.

ramkrishna [10:56 PM]
ok
yes it is :slightly_smiling_face:, I saw sign in button

aurelien [11:00 PM]
Note: the exercise 1.4 only works on Chrome. I’ll show the output in a few minutes if you don’t use Chrome.

prasad [11:05 PM]
@aurelien How can I download the files from jupyterlab?
jupyterhub

kidane [11:05 PM]
why is a dot needed after the numbers? if the dots are left out, error is generated

Shannon Cutt [11:06 PM]
You can download files from the Gitlab repo: https://resources.oreilly.com/live-training/introduction-to-tensorflow

prasad [11:06 PM]
making it a float
@kidane

prasad [11:06 PM]
@Shannon Cutt thanks

Mila [11:16 PM]
Is there any reason you have >>> in front of a = tf.constant([3, 3, 4])?

VK [11:16 PM]
show_graph(graph) does not display anything on my notebook

Lee [11:16 PM]
repl prompt

Mila [11:17 PM]
Thanks.

kidane [11:17 PM]
are tensors "like" variables in other programming languages?

Pravn [11:17 PM]
I am using Chrome and show_graph doesnt work for me too

Roberto [11:18 PM]
Is there any cost associated with the use of the eager mode?

Ehsan [11:20 PM]
If tf 2.0 is based on eager mode how we can use graph mode on that?

Shannon Cutt [11:22 PM]
Q from chat: are tensors almost same as weights in nn?

JasonM [11:39 PM]
yes

Derek Hakim [11:39 PM]
We can hear

Pravn [11:39 PM]
Yes, we can hear you

Ehsan [11:39 PM]
yes Ido

Shannon Cutt [11:39 PM]
Audio is working :slightly_smiling_face:

Shannon Cutt [12:02 AM]
Break time! Let's work on Ex 4 and we'll resume in 25 mins.

aurelien [12:03 AM]
Is everything okay everyone?  I’m not getting many questions, I hope it’s because everything is clear, not that you are all confused!  :wink:

Mila [12:41 AM]
what does tf.group do?

Marcio Aguiar [12:42 AM]
Based in our progress, do you think we can reach Segment 10 - CNNs tomorrow?

Marcio Aguiar [12:59 AM]
Everything clear :+1:

viplav [1:04 AM]
Regarding Batch size, if I have a very large data set (billions of rows), is it still preferable to have small batch size < 32?
ANd 32 was suggested for image recognition problems or any kind of problem?

kidane [1:06 AM]
audio has cut off

Shannon Cutt [1:06 AM]
Audio is still working
Please try refreshing your browser
If that doesn't work, please try leaving and rejoining the course. Thanks!

viplav [1:07 AM]
if i have small batch size .. it is not using cpu / mem efficiently

kidane [1:07 AM]
Thanks!

viplav [1:08 AM]
thanks
regarding evaluation step, should i evaluate a batch or the whole set (again for large data set) ?

viplav [1:19 AM]
sorry i was not clear, if i am trying to get a sense of evaluation loss, should I use a batch (which means it might not be accurate), or whole set (which means long time)
loss on validation set

VK [1:20 AM]
is there a notebook corresponding to the data api that you have just shown?

viplav [1:20 AM]
while training  ..

aurelien [1:20 AM]

viplav [1:21 AM]
try to see test loss progress while training ...
thanks

aurelien [1:24 AM]

viplav [1:26 AM]
thanks a lot

Mila [1:32 AM]
Thanks a lot for the great training.

Shannon Cutt [1:32 AM]
Thank you everyone who attended today’s course. We hope to see you all back for Day 2 of the course tomorrow.

Ehsan [1:32 AM]
Thank you

Marcio Aguiar [1:32 AM]
Thanks a lot!

aurelien [1:33 AM]
Cool!  I hope you enjoyed the course.

Lee [1:33 AM]
Thanks!

aurelien [1:39 AM]
Thanks everyone, any question?
All right, I’m off to bed then! :sleeping_accommodation: :zzz:
If you have any question, you can ask them here at any time, I’ll check them before the course tomorrow.
See you tomorrow everyone!  :+1:

Ehsan [11:35 AM]
Hi again, if everybody agrees, can we skip doing the exercises during the course to be able to cover all course material?

Roberto [6:45 PM]
@ehsan - your proposal sounds good to me.

aurelien [10:11 PM]
Hi @Ehsan, I think we will be fine, I skipped a few exercises yesterday to make sure we would be okay today.  There are just 3 fairly short exercises today, I’ll skip them if I see that we are short on time, but I don’t think we will need to.  Besides, without the exercises, people often dose off after 30 minutes, so we would have to replace the exercises with breaks anyway.  There will be a survey during the course today to ask whether people prefer that I talk about Keras (a simple high level API for neural nets) or Convolutional Neural Networks (a neural net architecture, ideal for image processing).

Welcome back everyone! Great to have you.

aurelien [11:02 PM]
As always I’m here to answer any question you may have :slightly_smiling_face:

Shannon Cutt [11:02 PM]
Let's take 10 mins for the exercise. Please post any questions if you have them.

aurelien [11:03 PM]
The exercise 7 is in the notebook 08_artifical_neural_networks_ex7ex8.ipynb

VK [11:07 PM]
Today I am accessing the course from my computer at NASA, and I am unable to go to your jupyter notebook site -- it is blocked as a security risk (in violation of Agency Internet Usage Policy NPD 2540.1H) -- maybe something O'Reilly might fix in the future.

aurelien [11:09 PM]
Perhaps you can clone the git repo and work locally ?  Thanks for your feedback. (edited)

Shannon Cutt [11:11 PM]
We're back! You should hear Aurélien again.

oon [11:19 PM]
when we use sparse and when we use dense?

Mila [11:33 PM]
Do we need to use the relu activation for the output node in regression?

Mila [11:38 PM]
Thanks, Aurélien.

aurelien [11:43 PM]
How’s everything going everyone? All clear? Going too fast? Too slow?

Shannon Cutt [11:55 PM]
We're back! You should hear Aurélien again.

Roberto [12:32 AM]
Q: Can you please provide the reference to the SELU paper?

Ehsan [1:05 AM]
What can be the difference between an image classifier for Cats, Dogs and Fish and a classifier that classify pictures based on differences not visible to naked eyes for example? is it the depth?

Ehsan [1:12 AM]
Hope you haven't answer my question for I had to refresh my browser and it took couple of minutes to join back. thanks
