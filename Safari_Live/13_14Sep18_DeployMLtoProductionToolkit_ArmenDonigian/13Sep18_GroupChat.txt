Victor d 9/13/2018 5:59 PM
Thank you very much Armen for the answer.

Derek H 9/13/2018 6:02 PM
Nilang and Hürriyet, you should be able to start the server and find contents in there to run as per Armen's instructions.

Derek H 9/13/2018 6:04 PM
You can download all of today’s notebooks and other files for local use from our course’s GitLab repository. Type the following into your favorite Terminal program: ```git clone <COURSE GITLAB REPO HERE>```

Victor d 9/13/2018 6:05 PM
I have a kind of technical question, can I do it here?

User 1 9/13/2018 6:06 PM
~$ git clone https://0636920201786.oreilly-jupyterhub.com Cloning into '0636920201786.oreilly-jupyterhub.com'... fatal: repository 'https://0636920201786.oreilly-jupyterhub.com/' not found

Derek H 9/13/2018 6:06 PM
If it's for Armen it's best to use Q&A

Derek H 9/13/2018 6:06 PM
if it's about the platform feel free to type it here

User 1 9/13/2018 6:06 PM
what is the git link?

Derek H 9/13/2018 6:06 PM
GitHub Link for Jupyter Notebooks for today and tomorrow's session: https://0636920201786.oreilly-jupyterhub.com

Derek H 9/13/2018 6:07 PM
This is what I have User 1. You should be able to start the server and access the materials.

Alex S 9/13/2018 6:07 PM
this is a cloud instance of a Jupyter Notebook server rather tha n a github/gitlab link

Victor d 9/13/2018 6:07 PM
Yes, I would like to know about Slack, it is going to be definitive group or only for these two days?

Victor d 9/13/2018 6:08 PM
Can I access it with my personal email? The one that is not registered in the event

Sandipan D 9/13/2018 6:08 PM
Getting the following error when trying to clone the repository ...

Sandipan D 9/13/2018 6:08 PM
git clone https://0636920201786.oreilly-jupyterhub.com Cloning into '0636920201786.oreilly-jupyterhub.com'... fatal: repository 'https://0636920201786.oreilly-jupyterhub.com/hub/' not found

Nilang P 9/13/2018 6:09 PM
I have the same issue.

Derek H 9/13/2018 6:09 PM
Victor, the slack channel will be archived. Your registered event email should be the one used for slack but if you email onlinetraining@oreilly.com with your personal email, I can add it.

Derek H 9/13/2018 6:10 PM
One moment regarding the Github.

Victor d 9/13/2018 6:10 PM
If it will be archived that is ok, I will access with my emails company. Thank you very much.

Li Z 9/13/2018 6:11 PM
Q: Does regression mean the same thing as clustering? I heard about clustering before, but heard about regression more often recently.

Derek H 9/13/2018 6:11 PM
You're welcome Victor

Sandipan D 9/13/2018 6:32 PM
Q: Are there any good self-serve tools you would recommend for acquiring data?

Li Z 9/13/2018 6:33 PM
Q: how can we determine concept drifts have occurred on the model (not sure if I get the words correctly)? Is it based on model prediction accuracy, or something else ?

Derek H 9/13/2018 7:05 PM
We will now take a 10 minute break. We will resume class when the break timer expires.

Victor d 9/13/2018 7:06 PM
Thank you for much so far for the answers

Derek H 9/13/2018 7:16 PM
Break has concluded. Class will now resume.

olivia b 9/13/2018 7:57 PM
during deployment are all the notebooks or pipeline converted to binaries?

olivia b 9/13/2018 8:03 PM
heard about flask for deployment how it is different from deployment with kubernetes and dockers like what is the simplest way to get started with deploying machine learning

Alex S 9/13/2018 8:08 PM
pandas_profiling is great for small datasets but doesn't scale well..

Surnjani D 9/13/2018 8:08 PM
Is there any pyspark version for pandas_profiling?

olivia b 9/13/2018 8:10 PM
when using pandas profiling don't you have to resolve those issues like creating dummies for cat values or writting functions to impute missing values?
